_**[Data Science Midterm: Analyzing Expected Risks Based on Natural Language Processing 10-Ks](report.md)**_

This midterm predicts S&P 500 company performance around their 10-K reports based on the sentiment of the reports. My midterm failed to achieve sentiment scores based on the actual 10Ks but used randomly generated scores to simulate the process and analyze the expected results vs the shortcomings of the actual deliverable.

_**[Final Project Dashboard: Custom Built Models Using Machine Learning to Predict Loan Defaults](https://loandefaultcustommodel.streamlit.app/)**_

This final project utilizes a dataset we used in class for our machine learning lectures. The dataset consists of 2013 loan data. We took the data, cleaned it, and used it to create a dashboard that allows users to customize the machine learning criteria they use in predicting loan defaults. We assess the accuracy of the model based on the actual loan defaults in our data, and display the results visualy with a confusion matrix. Results are then ranked on a leaderboard with prior custom models build on our dashboard.
